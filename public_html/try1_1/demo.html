                                                        <p>In the same vein, a Kaduna High Court Thursday ordered that the Executive Director, Agriculture and Environmental Care, Mr. Shedrack Madlion, be remanded to the EFCC custody over N7.2 million fraud.</p>
                                                        <p>The firm owned by the Admiral Murtala Inyako before he was elected Adamawa State Governor, has been managed by Madlion.</p>
                                                        <p>An EFCC source disclosed that the official was quizzed at its headquarters in Abuja over the fraud but was released pending investigation.</p>
                                                        <p>The source said that the anti-graft commission had delivered a letter of invitation last week addressed to the embattled official requesting an appearance before it with relevant documents concerning the N50 million that was meant for the purported 2007 Delta EXPO, which was never held.</p>
                                                        <p>Out of the N50 million, it was learnt that N35 million was supposed to have gone to the Tourism board.</p>

                                                        <p>In the same vein, the Federal Government Thursday inaugurated the boards of four parastatals under the supervision of the Ministry of Trade and Investment.</p>
                                                        <p>They are the Standards Organisation of Nigeria (SON), Corporate Affairs Commission (CAC), Nigerian Export Promotion Council (NEPC) and the Oil and Gas Free Zone Authority (OGFZA).</p>
                                                        <p>Minister of Mines and Steel Development, Musa Sada said that an inter-ministerial technical committee consisting of relevant ministries and security agencies has been mandated to review control of importation of ammonium nitrate and blasting accessories used in the formation of Improvised Explosives Devices (IED) by terrorists.</p>
                                                        <p>Speaking &nbsp;in Abuja, the minister said at a meeting with stakeholders on explosives that it was imperative that explosives, which were regarded as indispensable materials used in the mining sector do not get into the wrong hands.</p>
                                                        <p>Sada faulted the role of the private sectors in the indiscriminate proliferation of such sensitive commodities while citing the tragic explosive detonations in Lagos recently.</p>
                                                        <p>He added: “As you are all aware, IEDs have been widely applied by terrorists in causing considerable damage to lives and properties especially in the Northern part of the country.</p>
                                                        <p>Speaking during&nbsp; the inauguration ceremony in Abuja, the Minister of Trade and Investment,&nbsp; Olusegun Aganga, said members of the newly constituted board comprised men and women of integrity, knowledge and experience in the public and private sectors of the Nigerian economy.</p>
                                                        <p>The minister, who was represented by the Minister of State for Trade and Investment, Samuel Ortom, noted that the ministry and all its parastatals shared a common mandate anchored on: creating the enabling environment to stimulate domestic investment and attract foreign direct investment into all sectors of the economy and making Nigeria the most preferred investment destination, among others.</p>

                                                        <p>The Forum further stressed that failure to address the vexed issue may compel them to seek legal action in line with the provision of the 1999 Constitution on the Federal Character principles.</p>
                                                        <p>Speaking at the meeting, Chief Hannah Dideolu Awolowo said it was unfortunate that despite the massive support the South West gave to Jonathan during the 2011polls, they were being neglected in terms of appointments.</p>
                                                        <p>According to her, “The South West is too sophisticated for anybody to use and dump like we are witnessing now.”</p>
                                                        <p>She, however, noted that the President was simply taking advantage of the division among the Yoruba, adding,&nbsp; “otherwise there is no reason for what is happening.”</p>
                                                        <p>Speaking in the same vein, Chief Olu Falae said the birth of YUF was the direct consequence of the several failed attempts to reconcile the crises of the past.</p>
                                                        <p>According to him, “As long as we are not united, the Federal Government will continue to take us for granted. I am therefore appealing to all Yoruba people to come together under one umbrella for the progress and unity of the region.”</p>

                                                        <p>According to Okunrohunmu, “Although the representatives of the zones have their respective demands but the fact that a national confab is necessary was a common consensus.”</p>

                                                        <p>THERE were speculations that the seven French nationals kidnapped at the Cameroun boarder were in the early hours of Thursday sighted at&nbsp; Dikwa town in&nbsp; Borno State.</p>
                                                        <p>In a related development, the Ebonyi State Police Command Thursday, said it has arrested three suspects in connection with the alleged kidnapping of a three-year old boy, Emmanuel Ejike from Iyioji community in Akaeze council of the state.</p>
                                                        <p>Also, Chief of Naval Staff (CNS), Vice Admiral Dele Joseph Ezeoba has met with major stakeholders in the maritime sector on how to surmount the numerous security challenges currently confronting the country.</p>
                                                        <p>Meanwhile, worried by&nbsp; the security challenges in the country, the Federal Government has unveiled plans to further exploit electronic security system to ensure safety.</p>
                                                        <p>The Inspector-General of Police, Mohammed Abubakar, made this commitment &nbsp;during the presentation of 3000 police stands and patrol vehicles by Mikano International Limited in Lagos.</p>
                                                        <p>A Dikwa community resident, who spoke under anonymity, said that the French nationals were seen being transferred into an unmarked vehicle on the Dikwa-Gambouru road when the one they were being transported broke down.</p>
                                                        <p>Dikwa is a border town with Cameroon and about 85 kilometres East of Maiduguri.</p>
                                                        <p>The source added: “I cannot tell which direction the vehicle zoomed off to on the Dikwa-Gambouru road, but seven white people were among those seen coming down from the broken vehicle and entering another.”</p>
                                                        <p>Also speaking with The Guardian on the issue yesterday, the Borno State Comptroller of Nigeria Immigration Services (NIS), Babayo Alkali said: “I am just hearing it from you that some Dikwa residents sighted the abducted French nationals this morning. Well, security agencies, including our officers and men at the border posts with Cameroon are already at alert.”</p>
                                                        <p>Unidentified persons had on February 4, 2013 kidnapped Emmanuel in front of his parent’s house at Obulo-Iyioji village, Akaeze community, while disguised as customers to a shopkeeper there.</p>
                                                        <p>Briefing reporters on the development in his office, the Police Public Relations Officer, (PPRO) Sylvester Igbo, stated that one Chioma Obi and Chinonso Chukwu ,both from Enugu State and another person (name withheld) had been arrested in connection with Ejike’s abduction.</p>
                                                        <p>He added that the command had intensified efforts aimed at smashing the syndicate responsible for the serial abduction of children in Ivo council.</p>
                                                        <p>Igbo further noted that their Imo State counterpart had also arrested some suspects in connection with the kidnap of nine children in Ishiagu.</p>
                                                        <p>The meeting held at Naval headquarters Abuja provided a platform for the formulation of functional and effective strategies for improved security of the oil and gas resources and installations in the country.</p>
                                                        <p>Admiral Ezeoba, at the meeting, decried “the growing spate of illegalities” in Nigeria’s maritime environment especially the cases of crude oil theft, pipeline vandalism, piracy and militancy.</p>
                                                        <p>These, Ezeoba noted, “have constituted a threat to our national security and economic survival. These vices have further given the country image among the comity of nations. It is instructive to note that whereas illegalities in the offshore areas appear to be on the increase despite the presences of multiple security agencies within the environment.”</p>
                                                        <p>Abubakar said all efforts were in place to introduce many more safety gadgets that would aid policing the society.</p>
                                                        <p>According to him, the Police was presently facing challenges such as insufficient sophisticated equipment, training and manpower.</p>
                                                        <p>He said: “We are in the world of modernisation, so the police needs to catch up with modern equipment, to meet global standards. We cannot meet the standards now, in fact no country of the world has achieved that standard, but we are on the track.”</p>

                                                        <p>President of the Actors Guild of Nigeria, Ibinabo Fiberisima, in his condolence message said: “We will miss him in AGN. He was a father to us, always supporting us. Words cannot describe how I feel right now. He was a pillar to me from my early acting days to my campaign, election and till he died. He was always there for me. Uncle Justus Esiri was a complete gentleman, a disciplinarian, responsible and caring. He made me believe in myself and I thank God for his intervention in my life when I needed it. I will never forget his smile, which were very genuine and large always.”</p>
                                                        <p>In his own message, former President of the Directors Guild of Nigeria, Fidelis Duker, said: “Uncle Justus as I refer to him is one of Nigeria’s quintessential Thespians even though he had his training in engineering but he was able to distinguish himself in the creative industry. My closest encounter was after he won best supporting actor in AMAA and he had a cash prize attached to the award. Something unique that endeared me to him happened which I will keep for my book.</p>
                                                        <p>“In short, Mr. Justus Esiri was a great actor from Village Headmaster to Things Fall Apart as Obierika and importantly he remained a good man. I saw him last at the centenary brief by Senator Ayim Pius Ayim. I will always remember him.”</p>
                                                        <p>Veteran Actor, Victor Olaotan, of Tinsel said: “Justus Esiri I came know in the industry about ten years ago as a peculiar character in a good way. He was very professional in his ways and direct in his approaches mostly, a jovial man, you will have fun around him. In short, he was a nice guy, never had an argument with him, he will be greatly missed, particularly by the producers who are still in the middle of shoot with him. May his gentle soul rest in peace.”</p>

                                                        <p>‘’We have lost a great and iconic Thespian who traversed and walked tall like a colossus on the entertainment scene. From the village headmaster to the kingly roles he played, he was a master craftsman and wordsmith. Every role he played had a life. He motivated me and was a father figure to me. Odogobiri (his character in The King Must Dance Naked), rest well.&nbsp; You have played your part. You will be solely missed.’’</p>
                                                        <p>With these words yesterday, popular actor and former President of the Actors Guild of Nigeria Segun Arinze extolled the virtues of the late Justus Esiri.</p>
                                                        <p>To a prominent singer, Emem Ema, “Uncle Justus, was an icon. I had the opportunity to work closely with him last year. It was an experience for which I will forever be grateful, as I was able to tap into his wealth of wisdom and learned as much as I could about what we now know as Nollywood. I wish I could have spent more time with him, however, I am consoled in the fact that I came in contact and learnt from a true Thespian and icon of our time. My prayers and thoughts are with his family at this difficult time.”</p>
                                                        <p>Director and producer, Mildred Okwo, said: “I didn’t know him personally but I knew his body of work which I studied greatly in the hope of working with him in the future. I am saddened by his death but I am glad that he lives forever through his body of work.”</p>
                                                        <p>Award winning actress, Chioma Akpotha, expressed shock at the death of Esiri.</p>
                                                        <p>“Words fail me! His voice keeps ringing in my head…‘Chioma you have to dig deeper if you want to be different from the rest!’ Hmmm, I can’t believe he is gone. ‘No, it is JustUS!” he would correct in his unique voice and a grin on his face that gently transforms into a hearty laugh!&nbsp; &nbsp; O dear, I can’t believe he is gone. Many times a daddy he was to me. The actors’ actor. The veterans’ veteran. Rest in peace Uncle JustUS!’’</p>
                                                        <p>Joe Benjamin, another popular actor, said that Esiri was “a man of standard, one who was a father to all. I met him only once, which was recently. He exhibited so much wisdom. His demise is one that will be felt for a very long time. I sympathise with his family in this moment of grief and sadness, may God grant them the fortitude to bear this loss.’’</p>
                                                        <p><strong>Film producers mourn Esiri</strong></p>
                                                        <p><strong>By Florence Utor and Sony Neme</strong></p>
                                                        <p>Film producers in the country yesterday said that they were shocked by the news of Justus Esiri’s death, describing the deceased as a legend.</p>
                                                        <p>President of the Association of Core Nollywood Producers (ANCOP), Alex Eyengho, in an interview said, “we are still mourning Uncle Esiri with shock.”</p>
                                                        <p>Recalling the last time he saw the late Esiri, he said, “it was at the burial of Enebeli Elebuwa just some weeks back. He was full of life and spoke eloquently as usual, as he went down memory lane about how they started out as actors and as contemporaries. He did not show any sign of sickness.</p>
                                                        <p>“In fact, those who saw him a day before he died said that he was his jolly good self, as always. The only thing I can say is that no one knows when his or her end will come, except God, the giver of life. Truly, the industry has lost an irreplaceable legend and we shall all miss him.”</p>
                                                        <p>Presenter of the Big Brother Africa show, IK Osakioduwa, said Esiri’s death “is a blow and a sad story in the industry. The last time I saw him, he was full of life, as he spoke about how he saw his son, Dr. Sid from childhood, becoming a musician. He was so proud of him. So, waking up to hear of his death was one of the most shocking news I have ever received this year.</p>
                                                        <p>“He was one of the pioneers of the Nigerian entertainment industry, and I must say the industry owes him a huge debt based on his contribution to its growth, which cannot be quantified,” he added.</p>
